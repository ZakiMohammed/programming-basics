# Variables, Data Types and Conversion

The very basic building block of any programming language is variables, their data types and how conversion happens between these data types.

## Variables

Variable is something which holds up data of a particular type. Example:
```
int a = 10;
```

Variable creation consist of 2 parts declaration and definition:
```
// declaration
int a;

// definition
a = 10;

// usage
System.out.println(a);
```

    - Without Fractional Values: int, short, long
    - With Fractional Values: float, double
2. Character: char, String
3. Boolean: boolean

## Conversion

1. Implicit Conversion
